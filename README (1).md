# User Question Answering System

## Overview

This project is an advanced implementation of a Question Answering (QA) system using the BERT model. The QA system is trained on the SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset) to accurately answer questions based on a given context or passage of text.

## Features

- **Fine-tuned BERT Model**: Utilizes a pre-trained BERT model, fine-tuned on the SQuAD dataset for the QA task.
- **User Interaction**: Allows users to input a context (passage) and a question, and returns the most relevant answer from the context.
